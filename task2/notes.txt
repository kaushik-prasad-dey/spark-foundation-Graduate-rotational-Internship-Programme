The elbow method is a technique used in clustering analysis to determine the optimal number of cluster(k) for a given dataset.
it involves running a clustering algorothim with differnet values of k
and plotting the explained variation or distortion as a function of the
number of clusters.

The elbow of the plot is then used to identify the point where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the quality of the clustering.

General steps of the elbow method:
1. Run the clustering algorithm.
2. Compute a measure of variation.
3. plot the results.
4. identify the elbow.
5. select the optimal number of clusters.
